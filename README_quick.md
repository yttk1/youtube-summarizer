# Local Installer & Runner (quick)

Files:
- setup.sh   -> install dependencies, build frontend, create .env with OPENAI_API_KEY (prompted)
- run.sh     -> start backend + frontend locally and open browser
- logs/      -> runtime logs are written here
- .env       -> created locally during setup (do NOT commit)

Quick start (Ubuntu):
1. Make scripts executable:
   chmod +x setup.sh run.sh

2. Run setup:
   ./setup.sh
   - When prompted, paste your OpenAI API key.
   - This will build the frontend (frontend/dist) and create .env.

3. Start services:
   ./run.sh
   - This opens your default browser to http://localhost:5173

4. Stop services:
   ./run.sh stop

Notes:
- setup.sh installs Node.js (NodeSource) and Python venv tools if missing.
- The frontend reads its backend URL from frontend/dist/config.json which is generated by setup.sh (default: http://localhost:8000).
- The OpenAI API key is only written to .env and used server-side by the backend; it is never included in frontend bundles.
